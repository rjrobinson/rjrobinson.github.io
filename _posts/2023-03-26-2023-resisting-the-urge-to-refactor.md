title:  Navigating the Temptation to Refactor: A Guide to Responsible Code Maintenance
tags: software engineering, refactoring, code maintenance

Notes: 

Recently I bought a house. And we had a contractor come in, and take a look at out kitchen and one of our bathrooms. 
Immediatly he started talking about how he was going to gut the kitchen and the bathroom. That he coulden't understand
how someone would make these decisions. I would hear him stating "Why the hell would they run this shower drain like that?"
Or, "this is NOT the way that you would do this." For over 2 hours he was just ranting about how he would do it.

I get it. When I get into a codebase, I too have those same thoughts.I look at method names, flows, class names. Documentation.
And I suffer from the same temptation that this contractor did. I want to refactor. I want to make it better. I want to make it
the way that I would do it.

tl;dr - Don't do that. At least not yet.
